This is a simple website that I created last year. It looks like I spent five minutes on it and put absolutely no effort into the design. 

I used visual studio code editor and referenced w3schools.com/html. 

I would restart this website from scratch, if possible, and finish coding the cart and info pages. I didn't learn anything new from this project.
